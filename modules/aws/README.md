# Terraform Fake Modules for Amazon Web Services

A collection of fake AWS Terraform modules for example purposes when you need to demonstrate module behavior with tools like Terragrunt. Don't use these modules for testing, stubbing, or production. See [Terratest](https://terratest.gruntwork.io/) for how to effectively test Terraform.

### Requirements

These modules do make `data` calls, so you will need to have AWS credentials and a provider is required.
